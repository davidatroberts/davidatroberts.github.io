      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently moved the blog from using a really old version of Jekyll to Hugo. I wass really just looking for something a bit more lightweight and my old blog was failing to build on a new version of Jekyll anyway.
You may also notice that I&amp;rsquo;ve imported a lot of old content from a wordpress blog that I used to have before this one. I&amp;rsquo;ve took a bit of time to fix some old links to code examples and such that were broken.</description>
