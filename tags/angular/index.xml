      <description>When I was young there was one robot that I always wanted, that was a Sony Aibo, unfortunately the closest I ever got was playing with an ERS-7 at an after school club. I still don&amp;rsquo;t have a Sony Aibo and even though I keep looking at the ERS-1000 I would have to do some amazing mental gymnastics to be able to justify getting one.
Soon after the Aibo was released Silverlit developed the i-Cybie, a cheaper and less sophisticated robot dog.</description>
