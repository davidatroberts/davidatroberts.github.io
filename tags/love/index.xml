      <description>So, the usual excuse for not posting here busy and all that&amp;hellip;although I&amp;rsquo;ve been building quite a bit just forgot to upload any of it!
Anyhow to the point, I&amp;rsquo;ve begun rewriting one of my early lua games using the LOVE game framework called CodeCopy. The original code is pretty rough, and so I&amp;rsquo;ve been rewriting to make use of objects and make most of it a lot more reusable. As well as adding level editor and some other nice features.</description>

      <description>For anyone who&amp;rsquo;s been following my twitter feed you may know that I&amp;rsquo;ve been starting to develop a game in Lua and LOVE, a 2D game engine. After messing about with LOVE I found out that there was a version of love2D for the dingoo, canoo and gp2x called nLove. This is a great library that allows me to develop a game on my mac, using LOVE and then run it on my dingoo using nLove.</description>
