      <description>Browsing around the Modelzone shop in Westfields today I saw that the Big Trak Jr was on sale for Â£9.99. I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching these for a while but thought they were a bit too much for me to just take apart, but at the sale price I picked one up.
As soon as I got back home I put some batteries in, had a play with it and then promptly began dissassembling it.</description>
