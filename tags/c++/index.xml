      <description>Last year sometime I purchased a chumby one, with the main goal to develop some funky widgets and also I needed a new alarm clock. The widgets that are on the chumby site are all developed in flash, and I never quite got round to paying the massive price for the flash SDK, but luckily on the good ol&amp;rsquo;chumby board they&amp;rsquo;d released a C/C++ compiler. All great - except that there was no Mac OSX toolchain and I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like trying to get it to compile on OSX, lucky for me a native C++ compiler was made available.</description>
