      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been digging through some of my older projects (read abandoned) and I came across a small lua library I had started writing to interface with the frame buffer on the Chumby, source available:
 If I remember correctly the library works and allows you to draw to the screen using lua however it produces a segmentation fault I tracked the error down to the setup method that gets called when the library is first loaded.</description>

      <description>So, the usual excuse for not posting here busy and all that&amp;hellip;although I&amp;rsquo;ve been building quite a bit just forgot to upload any of it!
Anyhow to the point, I&amp;rsquo;ve begun rewriting one of my early lua games using the LOVE game framework called CodeCopy. The original code is pretty rough, and so I&amp;rsquo;ve been rewriting to make use of objects and make most of it a lot more reusable. As well as adding level editor and some other nice features.</description>
