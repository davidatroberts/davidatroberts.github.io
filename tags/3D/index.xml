      <description>Looking back on these posts, I should probably try to update them a little more frequently. I think I might stick to relatively short posts, that way I might actually get some more out!
Anyway, in the last post I described how I set up a development environment that was basically Xubuntu running in a virtual machine, and then SSHing into that from OS X. Well I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting that to use building a simple little software renderer for the Dingoo.</description>
