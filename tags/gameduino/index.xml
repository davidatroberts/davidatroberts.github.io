      <description>A few months ago on KickStarter I sponsored a project called the Gameduino, an add on shield for the Arduino, advertised as a game adapter for the Arduino. This is an awesome little device that has 32Kb of RAM, brings support for VGA output, stereo sound and has a co-processor that runs forth. See the official site for more information: http://excamera.com/sphinx/gameduino/. About two weeks ago mine arrived and since then in some of my spare time I&amp;rsquo;ve been working out how to output sprites and generally figuring out how it works.</description>
